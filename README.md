# Online-Retail-Capstone-Customer-Segmentation
UK-based Online Retail Stores Customer Segmentation using RFM (Recency Frequency Monetary) model.

Dataset Description
This is a transnational data set which contains all the transactions that occurred 
between 01/12/2010 and 09/12/2011 for a UK-based and registered non-store online retail. 
The company mainly sells unique and all-occasion gifts


1.Recency means the number of days since a customer made the last purchase. 
Frequency is the number of purchases in a given period. It could be 3 months, 6 months or 1 year. 
Monetary is the total amount of money a customer spent in that given period. 
Therefore, big spenders will be differentiated among other customers such as MVP (Minimum Viable Product) or VIP.

2. Calculate RFM metrics.

3. Build RFM Segments. Give recency, frequency, and monetary scores individually by dividing them into quartiles.
  b1. Combine three ratings to get a RFM segment (as strings).
  b2. Get the RFM score by adding up the three ratings.
  b3. Analyze the RFM segments by summarizing them and comment on the findings.

Note: Rate “recency" for customer who has been active more recently higher than the less recent customer, 
because each company wants its customers to be recent.

Note: Rate “frequency" and “monetary" higher, because the company wants the customer to visit more often and spend more money
